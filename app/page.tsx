					<strong>Work Life</strong>
					<br />
					My job is to create user-friendly digital experiences, and Iâ€™ve worked on various projects that showcase my technical skills and creativity. Recently, I interned as a <strong>UI/UX Intern</strong> at <strong>BanquetBliss</strong>, where I designed the complete banquet hall website. I have also developed a <strong>Fuel Delivery Bot</strong>, using Python and Google Maps API for location-based fuel delivery, and a <strong>Pitch Potential Predictor</strong> that integrates AI for evaluating business pitches.
